Now come to the next rule,
Spaces are not allowed in variable names but underscores can be used to separate words in variable names. 
For example, greeting_message works, but greeting message will cause errors.

Next rule is,
Avoid using Python keywords and functions names as variables names; that is, do not use words that Python has reserved for the particular programmatic purpose, such as the word print.

Finally a guideline, it will not give an error but will make programs easier to read and understand. 
Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, the name is better than n, 
student_name is better than s_n, and name_length is better than length_of_persons_name. See this variable is too long.
